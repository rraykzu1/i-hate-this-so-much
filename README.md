This branch adds 3 new pockets to the bag based on changes to it from later generations:

Medicine (HP, PP and status recovery items)
Power-Up (Vitamins and evolution items)
Battle Items (X items, Pokédoll/FluffyTail and hold items with battle effects)
The new order for the pockets is the following:

Items
Medicine
Poké Balls
Battle Items
Berries
Power-Up
TMs & HMs
Key Items
However, it reuses the original pocket sprites until I'm able to get new ones for the new pockets.

To-Do:

New bag sprites.
Pokémon Emerald
This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald.
